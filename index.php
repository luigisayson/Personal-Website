                        I am a recent graduate from the University of California, Irvine majoring in Computer Science and minoring in Spanish.
                        I aspire to become a Software Developer and am always open to new professional experiences. 
                        
                        I created this website to showcase my projects and achievements, while practicing my web development skills.
