        <p>INTRODUCTION</p>
        I am a fourth-year student at the University of California, Irvine majoring in Computer Science and minoring in Spanish.
        I aspire to become a Software Developer and am always open to new professional experiences. 
        
        I created this website to showcase my projects and achievements, while practicing my web development skills.
