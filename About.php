                    I am a fourth-year student at the University of California, Irvine majoring in Computer Science and minoring in Spanish.
                    I aspire to become a Software Developer and am always open to new professional experiences. 
                    
                    I created this website to showcase my projects and achievements, while practicing my web development skills.
